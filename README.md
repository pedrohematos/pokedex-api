### Example Endpoints

#### Get Pok√©mon Species Information

```bash
GET /species/{name}
```

**Description:** Retrieves detailed information about a Pok√©mon species by its name, including a treatment process to normalize the description text. The treatment process follows these rules:

- Page breaks are treated just like newlines.
- Soft hyphens followed by newlines vanish.
- Letter-hyphen-newline becomes letter-hyphen, to preserve real hyphenation.
- Any other newline becomes a space.

**Parameters:**

- `name` (string) - Name of the Pok√©mon species.

**Response:** `200 OK`

Returns a `PokemonResponseDto` object with the Pok√©mon species information.

```json
{
  "name": "blastoise",
  "description": "A brutal POK√©MON with pressurized water jets on its shell. They are used for high speed tackles.",
  "habitat": "waters-edge",
  "isLegendary": false
}
```

#### Get Translated Pok√©mon Species Information

```bash
GET /species/{name}/translated
```

**Description:** Retrieves detailed information about a Pok√©mon species by its name, including a translated description. If the Pok√©mon's habitat is a `cave` or if the Pok√©mon is `legendary`, the description will be translated using `Yoda` style. Otherwise, it will be translated using `Shakespeare` style. Prior to translation, the description undergoes normalization as part of the GET /species/{name} endpoint.

**Parameters:**

- `name` (string) - Name of the Pok√©mon species.

**Response:** `200 OK`

Returns a `PokemonTranslatedResponseDto` object with the species information, including the translated description.

```json
{
  "name": "blastoise",
  "description": "A brutal pok√©mon with pressurized water jets on its shell. They art did lay-to for high speed tackles.",
  "habitat": "waters-edge",
  "isLegendary": false,
  "translation": "shakespeare"
}
```
